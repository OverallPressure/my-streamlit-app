Welcome to a clean, Dockerized Streamlit app designed for rapid deployment of interactive data applications. This project acts as a solid foundation for scalable AI and ML explorations. It brings together the simplicity of Streamlit with the reliability of Docker and Docker Compose. Use it to prototype models, visualize data, and build dashboards that scale as your project grows.

This repository focuses on speed and reliability. It makes it easy to spin up a data visualization layer that connects to your AI or ML workflows. The app remains lightweight by default, but it is fully extensible. You can swap in your own models, data sources, or UI components without breaking the core structure. The goal is to keep the app approachable while providing a strong base for production-grade projects.

In this README you will find practical guidance, concrete examples, and sane defaults. The content is organized to help beginners get started and to give seasoned developers a clear path to advanced setups. The emphasis is on clarity and stability. You will see practical tips, common pitfalls, and a path to scalable deployments.

The repository topics reflect the scope and the domains this project touches. They cover AI, data science, deep learning, Docker, docker-compose, docker containers, docker images, Dockerfiles, machine learning, and Python. Each topic appears naturally as you explore the docs, code, and sample configurations. The topics help you discover related projects and learn how to extend this base.

Quick start
This section gives you a fast path to a running instance. The steps are designed to be straightforward. You will need Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. If you are new to these tools, this will also be a good opportunity to get comfortable with container-based workflows.

Prerequisites
- Docker Engine 20.10+ is required
- Docker Compose 2.x or newer is recommended
- A host machine with sufficient CPU and memory for your data flows
- Basic familiarity with command line usage

Step-by-step quick start
1) Clone the repository
- git clone https://github.com/OverallPressure/my-streamlit-app.git
- cd my-streamlit-app

2) Copy and configure environment
- Create a local environment file if you need to customize settings
- cp .env.example .env
- Edit the values to match your data sources and paths

3) Start the app with Docker Compose
- docker-compose up -d

4) Access the app
- Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser

If you prefer to run a release artifact
- From the Releases page you can download a release artifact that contains a ready-to-run bundle. After downloading, extract the package and run the startup script included in the artifact. The Releases page is the go-to place for stable builds and tested configurations. For the latest bundle, browse the Releases page and follow the extraction and execution steps described in the artifact documentation.

What you get
- A clean, modular structure that makes it easy to plug in new data sources and models.
- A Streamlit frontend that delivers fast, interactive analytics with minimal boilerplate.
- A Docker-based deployment workflow that supports local development and production parity.
- A ready-to-run container stack that minimizes system dependencies on the host.
- Clear separation between app code, configuration, and data assets.

Project goals
- Speed: Start quickly, iterate fast. The setup is designed to reduce friction when you begin a new data project.
- Stability: The default configuration favors predictable builds and reproducible results.
- Extensibility: You can swap in new components, models, or datasets without rewriting the core.

How it works
Overview
- The app is built on Streamlit, a lightweight framework for data apps. The UI code is clean and focused. The data processing layer can connect to various backends, including local files, databases, or model servers.
- Docker is used to isolate dependencies and provide a consistent runtime. The app runs inside a container, including the Python environment and all needed libraries.
- Docker Compose ties the containers together. The stack can include a reverse proxy, a data store, and optional auxiliary services.

Architecture sketch
- Client: Your browser renders the Streamlit UI.
- Frontend container: Runs the Streamlit server, serving the app and static assets.
- Data services: Optional databases or model servers that the app talks to.
- Reverse proxy: Routes requests to the app and can enforce TLS locally.
- Storage: Local volumes or external storage for data and caches.

Key design decisions
- Lightweight core: The default app is lean and fast.
- Clear boundaries: The UI, data processing, and model access are separated, which makes testing easier.
- Config-driven: Most variables live in environment variables or a .env file, not in code.

Docker and configuration
The project uses Docker to create a predictable environment. The docker-compose.yml file brings up all necessary services with sensible defaults. You can customize ports, volumes, and environment variables to fit your setup.

Sample docker-compose.yml
```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: streamlit-app
    ports:
      - "8501:8501"
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    environment:
      - STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=8501
      - STREAMLIT_SERVER_ENABLECORS=false
      - APP_DATA_DIR=/data
    depends_on:
      - data
    restart: unless-stopped

  data:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: streamlit-data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
      POSTGRES_DB: appdb
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  db-data:
```

Sample Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install core dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy app code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8501

# Start the app
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

Common environment variables
- STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT: Port the app serves on (default 8501)
- STREAMLIT_SERVER_ENABLECORS: Enable/disable CORS (default false for local deployments)
- APP_DATA_DIR: Directory for app data and caches
- MODEL_ENDPOINT: URL for a model server (optional)
- DATA_SOURCE: Type of data source (file, database, API)
- LOG_LEVEL: Logging verbosity (INFO, DEBUG, WARN)
- SECRET_KEY: A secret key for production (keep out of version control)

Local development tips
- Use docker compose up --build to pick up changes to dependencies or code.
- Use docker-compose logs -f to monitor startup and runtime messages.
- Mount code into the container for live reload during development.
- Use a lightweight mock data source during development to speed up iterations.

Data and persistence
- Data persistence is managed via Docker volumes. This ensures that data survives container restarts.
- For production, consider external storage options, such as network-attached storage or cloud databases.
- Keep model files and dataset caches in a dedicated directory to simplify backups and migrations.

Security and privacy
- Do not bake secrets into images. Use environment variables or secret management tools.
- Use a reverse proxy with TLS in production to protect data in transit.
- Restrict access to the app to trusted networks where possible.
- Regularly rotate credentials and monitor access logs.

Observability and testing
- Logs: The app emits logs to stdout. Collect logs with your container platformâ€™s logging facilities.
- Metrics: Integrate with a metrics system if you plan to scale. You can export key stats from the app and data services.
- Tests: Write unit tests for data processing and UI logic. Use end-to-end tests to verify the entire flow from input to visualization.

Development workflow
- Create a new feature branch for each task.
- Write tests for new features.
- Run the app locally with docker-compose up to verify behavior.
- Open a pull request with a clear description of the change, the tests you added, and potential risks.

How to customize and extend
- UI components: Add or replace Streamlit widgets to tailor the UI to your data story.
- Data sources: Swap in different data sources by adding adapters or connectors.
- Model hooks: Connect to a model server or embed a model within the container, depending on your needs.
- Styling: Apply custom CSS or Streamlit theming to align the look with your brand.

Accessibility and UX
- Ensure keyboard navigability for all widgets.
- Provide descriptive labels and helpful tooltips for complex controls.
- Keep the UI responsive to different screen sizes and devices.
